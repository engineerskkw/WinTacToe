class BasePolicy(ABC):
    """Class implements reinforcement learning policy.

    A policy defines the learning agentâ€™s way of behaving at a given time.
    Roughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the
    environment to actions to be taken when in those states. Formally,
    a policy is a mapping from states to probabilities of selecting each
    possible action.

    Methods
    -------
    __getitem__(key)
        Returns probability of taking the given action in the given state.
    epsilon_greedy(state, epsilon=None)
        Return epsilon-greedily chosen action.
    __str__()
        Get a string representation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : Tuple(BaseState, BaseAction)
